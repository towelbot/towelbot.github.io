  <p>You have found my webpage! Awesome! I have decided to start teaching myself how to some full stack development learning. I don't know exactly where that will take me, but I'm trying to think about improving myself at least daily. I have a <a href="/blog">blog</a> and have some random posts and stuff there. <br><br> I'm also going to have some pages where I put content in different formats while I play with the CSS and see what looks good to me. So, I'd say anticipate more and random content in the future. <br><br>Hi, I'm Talbot, thanks for joining me.</a>

  <!-- <h1 class="page-heading">Posts</h1>

 <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>

    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a></p>  -->
