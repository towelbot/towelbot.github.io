Hello,
<br><br>
Did one lecture on comparison operators for javascript in devslopes again. Or stackskills? Whatever. Typical stuff, and a simple if/else flow. I imagine that's gonna get more tricky, but for now seems manageable. Two things that are definitely going to give me pain:
<ul>
<li>=== Compares type and value</li>
<li>Single lines of code in loops don't require curly brackets (wait what? boooooo)</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
I also had to fix some really bad numbering conventions in post types and titles. But I also found out about the "duplicate" feature in Atom. So, that should make things easier.
<br><br>
Bye all.
