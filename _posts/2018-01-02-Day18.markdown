Hello,
<br><br>
Gonna do some work on the /web directory in my test branch today. Once I feel there's some content in the /web directory, I'll link it in a block post and add an actual link in the links page. Maybe I'll do that today actually, we'll see.
<br><br>
Then one or two lectures. See if I can knock it all out by 10am at work. Welcome to 2018
<br><br>
Good(?) morning!
