Hello,
<br><br>
Again, another no real news day. I'm gonna start back up on the Devslopes classes again tomorrow. Been doing a little bit of bitcoin mining research instead. Seems that software that's out there really wants you to use pools n such. I think it sounds a little scammy. Still needs more doing. Anyway. Happy Sunday
<br><br>
Catch ya later.
