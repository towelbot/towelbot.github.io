Hello,
<br><br>
Decided to add bootstrap to my working /Web directory. Made a photo carousel in the photos section. Getting the sizing right is proving a challenge, but I hacked in the framePic class to what bootstrap gave me and it seems to be sort of janky working, but working. Someting is scrolling the screen up and down on the first picture.
<br><br>
Also added some content to my games.html. Nothing fancy, just something there.
<br><br>
Night!
