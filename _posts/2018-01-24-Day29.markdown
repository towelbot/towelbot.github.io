Hello,
<br><br>
Today was start /Devslopes6 where I'm being walked through making an entire website in Bootstrap 4. I'm pretty sure I don't need it, but it's a step and pactice. I'm keeping an assets2 folder around with pictures of the NES game Skate or Die instead of an actual skateboarding website. But we'll see how it goes. I imagine I'll have to specify more dimensions and stuff to make it worth it, and stuff. So I'm not sure.
<br><br>
Bye
