Hello,
<br><br>
Well, that day just got all the way away from me. No IRC. No coding classes, no content improvement at /Web. Sheesh. I worked from home, and got a couch delivered, and did laundry, then went out for dinner with my partner and saw some old friends. It was a good night, but a long day. Now, I'm thinking instead of working, some more, grab an episode or movie on Netflix and then turn in.
<br><br>
Till later
