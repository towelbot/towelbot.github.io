Hello,
<br><br>
Working on making the Devslopes website mine. Created a /web directory in my test branch to make a website with less BS content and more my content. I won't be fixing the colors I don't think for the time being, but still have a lot to learn about CSS and formatting in HTML with Divs (which I did NOT learn in high school).

Later
