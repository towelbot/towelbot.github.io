Hello,
<br><br>
Tried a react class in the bundle from the thing I bought from Joe something or other, and he has lectures straight up missing. Which is fine some times, but I don't feel like going through that, after not explaining a lot of his dependencies. I feel like I'd get stuck. Maybe I'll come back, maybe I won't. Anyway. Wasted time to recoup.
<br><br>
Cheers.
<br><br>
