Hello,
<br><br>
Playing with stuff to get to firebase. Not exciting or sexy, but I have a custom 404 page now. yay. The rest is straight from my github commit comments:
<br><br>
<br>Created a custom 404 page that matches rest of website styling.
<br>Created a firebase status page. Maybe.
<br>Fixed the header field to be much smaller than it was before.
<br>Added links to firebase hosted content.
<br>
<br>
tired goodbye.
