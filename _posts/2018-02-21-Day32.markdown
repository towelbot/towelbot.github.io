Hello,
<br><br>
Another day, another class. Today's adventure in the /Devslopes6 directory was another nested row and column using Bootstrap 4 assets with some class wrapping for centering purposes. If I get nothing else out of Bootstrap, it makes my own CSS file look way more clean than doing it all by hand.
<br><br>
Peace
