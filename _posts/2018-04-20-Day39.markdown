Hello,
<br><br>
Still tired as all hell. However, went through more DB training in mongo with some product and wishlist construction. Kinda neat. Wondering if I should be trying to do these steps with firebase instead. We'll see.
<br><br>
Also did some work on Webv2 for about and some CSS update to match theming a little better. Thinking about changing fonts on headers and footers. Nothing in stone yet.
<br>
<br>
Toodle... oo?
