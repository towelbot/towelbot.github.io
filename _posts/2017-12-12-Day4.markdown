Hello, have an update!
<br><br>
The class I'm taking is called: Beginner Full Stack Web Development: HTML, CSS, React & Node from Devslopes, but I'm using it at stackskills.com. It must be the stack social coupon team doing a streaming service or some thing.
<br><br>
I managed to successfully merge my test and development websites that I've been making for the Devslopes in github pages. There's no content and everything is a damned placeholder, but there it is.
