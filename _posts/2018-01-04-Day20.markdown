Hello,
<br><br>
No devslopes lectures today. But I had to figure out what was going on with the mobile version of my website at twistedsyx.net/Web . The problem is a viewport wasn't set, but I'm not sure how that affected mobile browsers going to the website. Which is a bit of a bummer. So, I'll figure that out today and work on shoring up the template I want to use for the website before figuring out more content.
