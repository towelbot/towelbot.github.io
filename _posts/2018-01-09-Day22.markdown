Hello,
<br><br>
Being busy still basically all the time. But did yoga twice since then I'm pretty sure. Hooray! Anyway, finished some lectures on Github and merge conflict resolution. Seems pretty chill. NBD. git mergetool is your friend when Atom doesn't have the same plugins as your lecturer. No new content posted, I'll try to update the games portion of the /web site today for some content practice.
<br><br>
Bye!
