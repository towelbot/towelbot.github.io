Hello,
<br><br>
Quick update today. I've been working on finding and customizing the CSS of the blog and link posts on this Jekyll website. There's now a links page with some links to my devslopes classes to start with. I'll dump resources I've been collecting over time to make this website and other stuff.
<br><br>
This has been a learning experience and so I'm planning to finish this full stack development class before taking additional python video courses.
<br><br>
Hugs n kisses everyone.
